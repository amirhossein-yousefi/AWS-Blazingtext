__label__0 "i wanted this top in a petite xs but it was sold out so i got the xs . i 'm 5 ' 2 with a 34b bust and while the bottom comes down to my waist like on the model the sleeves are a bit long ... they seem a little long on the model too . i wore this to work and constantly had to pull my top back as the scoop neck kept drooping down as i moved around throughout the day . really like the tie neck feature though ."
__label__1 "i loved this top from the first time i saw it online . i ordered a size 10 ~i 'm slim with broad shoulder & 36c~ the top fit perfect . when i opened the pkg i thought it would be too big since it looked wide but that was not the case at all . its a little longer in the back & a little shorter in the front . on me~it looks exactly like it does in the picture.its really a cute top & it looks lovely over shorts . makes a cute casual summer outfit . i cant wait to wear it ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this in a size 1 which i thought would be a small and it was very very wide . it is very short too . i typically wear a small and am 5 ' 8 and 132 lbs . it 's going back unfortunately . very soft material though ."
__label__0 "this dress is well made and of good quality it just looked a little too old on me . the skirt was heavy and the fabric was cozy perfect for a fall outfit ."
__label__0 "when you buy a dress full price and it goes on sale before you can even wear it ( $ 168 down to $ 49 ) uuuuggghhh ... i like the dress fine enough but it has a weird under wire it makes my chest look strange like i do n't fill it in . i usually do n't have that problem as a c cup . more orange/red then yellow as well . would n't recommend ."
__label__-1 "i am typically a small/6 in dresses but i should have gone with the other reviewers and sized down . it had no shape but hung like a paper sack . the armholes fit perfectly though if i had sized down they may have been too tight . i am 5 ' 6 140 lb i will return too bad because it is a pretty dress !"
__label__-1 "i tried this dress on in the store . i loved the fabric and color but the fit was huge no matter how much i sized down . there are full dresses and tunics that are supposed to be loose but this was shapeless in an unflattering way . i was attracted to the style and color but the execution left much to be desired ."
__label__-1 "i splurged on this top and was sadly disappointed . i 'm a 36d and the l was so tight i could n't get it over my chest . also the arms were super tight and the length is nearly cropped . and the fabric is shiny the picture makes it look like it 's matte . if it did fit like the model i would 've loved it . the print is beautiful though . bummer"
__label__0 "i really liked the look of this top online but when it came i had a couple of issues with it . first when i tried it on i found the underarms to be a little snug ( i normally wear a 10/m and that 's what i ordered ) . it makes raising my arms tough and as a teacher i need to be able to lift my arms above my waist . secondly my husband 's first reaction was that it looks like pajamas . the abstract floral/stripe gets a little lost . on the other hand the color palette is very pretty and the qual"
__label__0 "i read the reviews before i bought this dress and had trouble believing that the dress literally fell apart at the seams so i bought it . first the good : i love the color the fabric and the design . it 's very lightweight and loose-fitting and is perfect for hot days . the neck and sleeves are pretty on . i can wear it as a cover up or put on a necklace and sandals for everyday errands and things . now the bad : it literally falls apart at the seams as you take it out of the package ! im surprised a"
__label__0 "i really really wanted to take this home with me but decided against it . from the front this dress looks amazing when it was belted and i love the colors in it . however it bunched like crazy in the back . i tried it without the belting and it just hung like a sack and was completely unflattering . if there were some way to get rid of the bunching in the back then i would have taken it home . but with the cost of the dress i ca n't justify taking it to a tailor so it stayed . sigh . so close ."
__label__1 "bought these online - sale and am really happy with them . soft and light material - feel breezy like a beach pant should !"

__label__1 "i did not have the same experience as the other reviewers . found the color just as pictured - a dusty pink ( made to look worn - so may not be your thing ) . fabric hangs nicely and is slimming on me . long enough for leggings but great with jeans booties and long necklace ( needs accessorizing ) . the aged look may not be for all but overall i love it ."
__label__-1 "i love the way this dress hangs straight down on the model but on me it looked tacky . i 'm 5 ' 6 and 130 lbs and this dress hit me in all the wrong places . i got a size small- sizing up would be huge in the top of the dress ( and the arm holes are already dangerously large ) . i wish this were just a little bit a-line . instead it 's literally like someone just extended the length of a t-shirt ."
__label__0 "i love the way this top looks in the picture and the embroidery is as lovely as it appears -- very detailed . it is both subtle ( not cheap looking ) and special . as an earlier reviewer noted the top is not see-through a plus . the drawbacks though mean that i will be returning this top . 1. the fabric is very heavy and does not drape well . i am a small woman with a large chest and ordered a size 0. the top is still loose even in that size and the relative stiffness of the fabric gives"
__label__-1 "beautiful color and the fabric is very substantial and soft . but they did n't finish the bottom hem ! the dress is lined and the bottom inside has a ribbon sewn in as a type of hem but the actual edge is just cut and not turned in on itself . because of this the whole bottom had a hundred little fabric frays . the rest of the dress is so polished it just does n't make sense . also while the fabric is beautiful my dress had a weird mark on the chest almost like a water mark . just overall bad attent"

__label__-1 "the top on the model in the photo is a true ivory but the top in reality is more beige . well i 'm blonde with fair skin so i 'm not sure this is going to work . it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality with it really being beige having pleats everywhere and being a crinkly fabric it looks more casual . i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts"
__label__-1 "as others have said this is cropped so will look funny with most pants that are n't high waisted . i 'm going to try it with a few dresses before i return it . the lining is adorable so i do n't want to have to send it back ."
__label__1 "this is the perfect holiday dress . my best purchase of the season !"
__label__0 "i have to send the skirt back . i agree with other reviewers who say the slits are extremely high the underskirt bunches and the fabric snags easily . additionally the yarn was already fraying at the top of the slits and the label was stitched on the outside of the waist band . disappointed in the quality of this skirt given the pretty steep price ."
__label__-1 "did not work for me . material was a bit thin poor quality the tie does n't quite work correctly . had a cheaper look to it . not the quality i 'd normally expect . this is going back ."
__label__0 "i 'm normally a 10/12 and ordered the m/l . the body was a little big but ok. the arms are really wide . there are snaps to make them tighter but it does n't do much . i do like the embroidery . it 's an ok jacket but the fit could have been better ."
__label__1 "i feel like i have a lot of blouses like this so it really needed to wow me to keep it . and while it is lovely well made and very pretty and delicate ... i just did n't feel like it was anything special . if you do n't have a blouse like this then it is a great find . but it is nothing super out of the ordinary ... fit i feel is tts ... i am in between a m and l ... i ordered the l. lots of room in the body although i did n't like where the arms hit on me . they are n't wrist length but they are n't mid-fore"
__label__1 "i love the print of this dress ; the deep blue really is striking . i agree with the other reviewers that it has no lining and therefore it 's hard to justify the price . i ca n't seem to part with it yet due to the lovely print and the off the shoulder style is romantic and flattering . still on the fence . . . it would be better as a sale piece ."
__label__1 "these are super soft and relaxed . i have them in navy and lavender . i am 5 ' 6 and 130 lbs . and ordered them in a 28 which fits loosely but comfortably ."
__label__0 "loved the design and print of this blouse . however every time i put it on or took it off i could hear the seams ripping . definitely was n't because it was too small either ."
__label__0 "i never write reviews"
__label__1 "i had to size up to a medium because otherwise my boobs would not get along well with that button down front but once that was taken care of i really loved the silhouette this created . the belted waist flatters an hourglass shape nicely . perfect for sipping tea and eating finger pastries like a fancy little lady . i have no idea what i 'm going to do when the time comes to wash it though ... we 'll cross that road when we come to it i guess . also - the interior seams are a bright electric blue -"
__label__-1 "this is the worst shirt i have ever tried on from retailer . it is basically a big shaggy box from the front and from the side it looks like a tent . it is also short ."
__label__0 "cute little dress fits tts . it is a little high waisted . good length for my 5 ' 9 height . i like the dress i 'm just not in love with it . i dont think it looks or feels cheap . it appears just as pictured ."
__label__0 "i love this dress ! the print and the fabric make it a fun uncomplicated outfit choice that can be dressed up or down very easily . that being said there are two issues i wish i had known about although i probably would have purchased anyway . 1 ) it has pockets -yay ! ! ! but also the pockets create a bulge where they hit my hips and it 's not a flattering spot on me to have an extra bulge . 2 ) i washed before wearing because it was super wrinkled and me and the iron are n't friends anymore . so i thr"

__label__0 "this is a beautiful looking dress but definitely runs wide and long . i 'm 5 ' 4 112llbs and my normal xs swallowed me up . if it had been available in xs petite then that probably would have worked even though i normally never go with petites . it is a gorgeous dress and would probably work on those ladies who are taller ."
__label__0 "i ordered this dress online in order to get a petite size and am very disappointed . as other reviewers have mentioned the fabric overlay is very different in person than it appears in the online pictures . the dress is much more casual and looks cheaply made in person . as for sizing i ordered the 2p based on other reviewers ' comments about it running small . the 2p fit me fine although it was very fitted in the chest and i am very small chested # 32b # . i can definitely see that being an issue"
__label__0 "i wanted to give this a try but unfortunately disappointed with the fit and styling . i 'm 5 ' 6 petite build and it consumed my slim figure . i loved the soft and coziness and the color is sweet too . i just felt like an awkward butterfly with the sleeves . pinning them back would have been alright but the execution did n't fit my frame . i would have liked it to be a tad longer too . i really hope they use this same material throughout the fall season because it 's so cozy ."
__label__1 "so simple to throw on with jeans or you could dress it up . the ruffles give it a little extra flair . nice and soft really comfy . i have n't decided which size i am going to hold onto . i ordered in a small and a medium . small fits me great and i am usually a pretty standard medium . i think it just depends on what look you are going for . wish they had it in a lighter color like an ivory or pink . i think the ruffle detail would look nice with a lighter shade ."
__label__-1 "you have to be a contortionist to get this bra on . it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows . ridiculously impractical . why oh why did n't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead ?"
__label__1 "love bailey 44. this dress does not disappoint . the blue is beautiful and the fit is very flattering . the material is really soft and the dress is very comfortable ."
__label__0 "this dress could have been great but for me there was too much design on the top part/ front . i wish the neckline was different or just less beadwork/ design near my face . all in all its a maxi dress and was returned because approx . $ 250 was too much to spend on this ."
__label__1 "the color and quality of these jeans is great . they were too large in my normal size . more of a boyfriend fit so size down ."
__label__0 "as other reviewers have noted this is a pretty top . i really love the design . alas however it is too big for my frame . for reference i am barely 5 ' 1 and about 105 lbs . i ordered my usual xxsp and the fit is just not flattering on me . it is looser than on the model and the flounce does not hit me in the proper place . the top is also too wide so that it has these odd gaps near the armpits . i highly recommend this top unless you are an xxsp . i am going to have to part with it sadly ."

__label__0 "absolutely stinning dress ! statement piece for sure however i will agree with other reviews that the bust is small and has no give or wiggle room with the side zipper ... one if those dreaded side zippers that you always fear breaking as you dress . sizing up would help but the waist then appears too big or bulky .. i am on the fence about whether or not it 's a keeper ... definitely perfect for the smaller chested . i usually wear xs size 2/4 the 6 zipped the 4 nearly did but would 've smashed . neverth"

__label__0 "loved these pants when i tried them on they looked great and felt so comfortable . when i washed according to the directions on the tag the bottom of one leg lost so much color that i ca n't wear them anymore .. so disappointed !"
__label__-1 "i actually had no problem with the neck hole of this shirt even with the xs size . however i had a huge issue with the bottom eyelet section . it 's so tight ! it stretches across my thighs and looks so funny as the top part is still loose . i tried moving up to a size small and still had this problem . maybe just not for girls with thighs ... very strange fit ."
__label__-1 "cute in theory i love the bright colors the tied black collar sash and the 70 's vibe however the fabric is cheap and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern . maybe this was intentional but with the shirt i received it looked horrible . i sent it back . i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam so it is a bit deceiving . i would n't buy this top at any price based on"
__label__1 "the picture does n't do these justice ! they are beautiful and a must-have for summer date nights . i am 5 ' 2 and hover between 115-120. i tried on the regular size in-store and they were way too long . so i ordered the xs petite and they fit perfectly ! i like to pair them with a flowy top that hangs over the waist band . ( not styled like the pic ) . they literally feel like you are wearing nothing . you 'll receive so many compliments - trust me !"

__label__1 "this dress is very soft and ultra comfortable . i got a size 10 and probably could have gotten away with an 8 but due to being busty on top stuck with the 10. i love the length even though i got the regular and not the petite ."
__label__0 "i so wanted to love this but was underwhelmed - ii am tall but yet it hit below my knee in that awkward spot that is just a tad too long to be hip stylish and too short to be evening cocktail - just felt / looked frumpy ... i do think it looks great on other reviewers though so may just be that if was n't a good fit for my body type - i wore my normal size 6 and it just did n't flatter - made me feel 10 years older"

__label__-1 "i really loved this skirt on the model but it just was n't flattering when i received my order . i ordered two sizes - 2 and 4. i am 5 ' 4 athletic build and the front closure made my waist look much larger than it is . the back of the skirt also flared out more than i expected it to . sadly i had to return both . perhaps this would look better on someone with a much taller frame ."

__label__-1 "as another reviewer pointed out although the tag inside the dress says that you can machine wash in cold water the color around the popsicles will bleed ! this is extremely disappointing . i 'm hoping it can either be fixed with dye remover or that retailer will take this item back . would only dry clean this item ."
__label__1 "lovely dress in bright teal color . the zipper was a bit sticky as the other reviewers had mentioned . unfortunately i sized up ( 6 ) based on past reviews and had to exchange for a smaller size ( 4 ) . the fabric does have a bit of stretch so i 'm really not sure why so many people had sizing issues . this is really a great buy with the current sale . tempted to pick up the red version too ."

__label__0 "bought this dress without trying it on but listened to the previous reviews saying this ran small and wow does it . i usually wear a 6 but ordered an eight which was hard to get on even with the upsizing . i do have a 34ddd bust so i do have a difficult time when dresses have no stretch over give in that area . overall beautiful dress fabric is not stretchy which killed it for me ."

__label__0 "i ordered the dress online and found it to be not as pictured . the length hit several inches above the knee . the sleeves are also 3/4 length rather than full length as pictured . i found the cut to be much less fitted through the torso as well . i tried both the small and xsmall which are my usual sizes . the small was very loose through the torso the xsmall was better but looked overall too short as if it were a petite cut . i am 5 ' 9 however the model is supposed to be 5'10 ."

__label__1 "this blouse is so pretty ! i love the design the material and the pattern is so unique . i love the sleeves and how they billow out just above the elbow and come in at the wrist . i think the amount of fabric is perfect and would not be nearly as nice with less . the cut around the top where it starts to gather and fall is so feminine and modern princess-feeling . i hope they make this same style in other colors and prints ! ! ! i adore it and feel so good wearing it ! if i could change anything i 'd m"
__label__-1 "this looked so odd on me ! i decided to give it to someone with a different body type and she found it really odd too . the sleeve are a bit too long to be short and they are tight at the bottom . the top is really large as to be unflattering . perhaps it 's just that it does n't work on someone who is petite but this one is a return ."
__label__0 "this vest was of excellent weight but it had very little style . it was like a giant piece of felt was cut out with little thought to design or nuance . not for me ."

__label__1 "i slightly balked at the cost but i am completely satisfied and glowing about the product and it is made in the usa . in these times that means a lot . 100 % supima cotton and the perfect design with reasonable deep v-neck front and back and the slightly lengthened sides very ultimate design for a tee . i bought the dark grey ; the tag says wash before wearing which is one extra step ... still i find this supima cotton tee pretty much divine . i bought the dark grey in medium my usual ( size"

__label__1 "ca n't say about fit just yet since it is a gift ; color is soft green and versatile . finishing touches around edges and in back make it a stand out sweater that dresses up jeans but also nice over a dress or with skirt"

__label__-1 "i read the existing reviews before purchasing and a few mentioned that this sweater ran large . this has been my experience with most tops i have purchased from retailer . i figured by ordering a medium i would receive a slightly loose to moderately loose fitting sweater . this was not the case ! the sweater is short does not look anything like it does when you view the model from behind ( and i assume the model is taller than i ... as models are usually tall ) . for reference i am 5 ' 6 '' medium build"

__label__1 "this is absolutely beautiful . the picture online does n't do it justice . i slipped this on with skinny jeans in the store and was hooked instantly . fit was a little large . i would have tried a petite but this shirt does n't come in petite sizes . love this !"
__label__1 "this top fits exactly like the last photo which was my hope . it is not as slim as the other images . it 's a swing top and the arm holes are perfect size and the mock turtleneck is not too high . the fabric is thick so will be perfect transitioning from summer to fall ."
__label__0 "i loved this at first .... but the quality is awful ! it pilled like crazy and started to get little holes near the neck after 4-5 wears . second sweater from retailer this year with severe pilling issues . i love retailer but will never again buy another sweater here ."

__label__0 "i want to love this dress . the colors and the fabric are absolutely beautiful . it is definitely a swing-dress . much wider than i expected ... and i sized down . there is also a strange pooch in the shape around the middle . i am keeping it because i am in love with the the colors and print and it looks very flattering when paired with a black denim jacket just not alone ."
__label__0 "i really really wanted to love this dress . the v-neck plunge is way too deep . i needed to pin it to keep it closed . the blue color was pretty and the front was flattering but the back was not . it was super clingy in the back and did n't hang in a flattering way . sadly i sent it back ."

__label__0 "this is a very pretty shirt which is too narrow across the back . i need to be able to move my arms freely at work so this did not work for me . you may be able to size up for a better fit if moving your arms is important to you ."
__label__0 "this shirt is cute nice cut but i do n't love it . best as a sleeping tank ."
__label__-1 "the buttons on the back are very tedious . you will need someone to help you . if you get past that hurdle then you have the look of a little girl in a smock . way too big . like a nightgown . nice quality but not practical ."
__label__0 "i loved this shirt online and ordered it in blue immediately even though i usually hesitate to spend over $ 100 on casual blouses . unfortunately i was super disappointed when it arrived . the lace does not contrast as much as shown in these pictures and it just does n't look all that special . having said that it is super comfy and soft and the sizing is generous - it may run big on you if you have a small chest . all in all i would buy it on sale but certainly not worth the price tag !"
__label__-1 "beware . white is not white . white is more cream off-white light beige . i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color . they are cute but not white . i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer but unfortunately creamy colored shorts do n't do much for navy/white tops.also the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok ."
__label__1 "this is a lovely dress . it is on the heavy side and lined so i would not recommend for hot summer wear . but the material and style are adorable . the skirt is definitely a-line not sheath but i prefer that . it runs a tad too tight in the chest so if you 're between sizes in the bust i 'd order up . that said a 6 would be too big for me . i 'm 5 ' 4 120 lbs and 34c and usually wear a 4 ."

__label__-1 "i 'm normally a small in retailer tops . i ordered a small and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper ( more fitted ) part . it all went horribly wrong from there . the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent instantly adding a good 50 pounds to my frame . this was such a disappointment as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality ."
__label__1 "this is ruching done right ! i tried this dress on and the two other women who saw me in it went to try it on as well . it is fitted but comfortable and because it is well cut the ruching hides a multitude of sins to leave you looking sleek and curvy in all the right places . it is also a versatile layering piece and would look great with almost anything . so unless this particular color is your nemesis this dress is a winner !"

__label__0 "let me start by saying that i can not wear wool . it does n't matter what type it is or if it is combined with cashmere it makes me itch so much that i just ca n't do it and i did n't not find this as itchy as others stated . that being said you definitely need to size down . i am a standard small and purchased the xs and there is still a load of fabric . i still do n't know what to think . i think it is okay but i am not sure it justifies the price point ."
__label__-1 "this had a cute design but an unflattering fit for me . it was boxy and made my boobs look droopy ."

__label__0 "this dress in coral is a beautiful color and awesome material . only problem is it runs a little big- i am a pretty true to size small and should 've ordered an xs- the hips are a little wide and v in the neck a little low . instead of sending back i just wore a camisole and leggings w ankle boots and it looked very cute regardless ."

__label__-1 "i do n't normally write reviews but this shirt was so terrible that i felt inspired . first off the seam that is in both the front and back of the shirt is much more pronounced than in the photo . secondly there is no shape whatsoever unlike in the photo . it bells out like a tent . it honestly looks like a shirt you would buy if you were trying to appear pregnant when not . overall this shirt is an insult to the female form . retailer what is with all of these shapeless frocks in cheap f"
__label__1 "i 'm small ( 4'11 98 pounds and 34a ) so the regular xs looks like a baby doll dress on me . i just wear the tunic with a tank top underneath ( or i can wear the tunic by itself ) and leggings plus a pair of boots . the top part is slightly baggy so if you want tight fitting is size down to xxs . i got the yellow flower and white + grey one and plan to get the navy one soon . the quality is good and you can machine wash it with cold water . i plan to use a tide sweater garment bag to wash it ( i put"
__label__1 "prior reviewer nailed it with the summary of this dress . it definitely needs heels . i 'm 5 ' 4 120 # 34d and this is a size 36. i usually wear a size s or 4 with most retailer stuff ."
__label__-1 "this skirt is beautiful . fabric is gorgeous with perfect amount of shine and luxury to it . there is a life in this skirt ; it is well made and follows the body lines in a perfect way . or i better say it did fit me perfectly first ten minutes of wearing it . unfortunately it stretched more than a full size and generally lost its shape . now the skirt is two sizes too large and not really wearable anymore ."
__label__0 "i have been lusting after this dress and though tit would be great for thanksgiving . the fit for me however is totally wrong . for reference i 'm 32dd 5 ' 8 140 lbs and am a s or 4. the small fit well in the body area but felt a little small in my upper arms . the arm length was more of a 3/4 sleeve on me which looked terrible because the sleeves are baggy . the quality felt like it was lacking too . the material felt like it would pill easily . order with caution ."
__label__0 "first of all this top runs big . i 'm 5 ' 5 120 and there was still plenty of room to spare in an extra small . this is a cute top but i returned it because it was too stiff and boxy for me . the fabric is thicker than your average tee and there 's not much give so it may not hang well on all body types . i might revisit it if it goes on sale because i like the design with the small details at the sides but this was an easy pass for me at the regular price ."

__label__1 "i tried on the blue in store and ordered the red in petite and they are both too long ( which means i will have to hem ) . i am not sure if i want to spend the extra money on hemming so hanging on to them for now as i love hte cut and color . they fit like a glove otherwise ( i do have muscular thighs ) . the 0p is good for me ( 115 lbs ) . ca n't go wrong for a nice pant i can see wearing these out or for work ..."
__label__-1 "i wish i had read all the reviews before purchasing . the sweater looked liked everything i would be interested in online . once i pulled it out of the bag my first thought was how could retailer send me a used washed and shrunken sweater . it is nothing like the picture . it fits like a midriff top not exaggerating . i 'm 5.6 ordered the m do n't waste your shipping money on this ."
__label__1 "this sweater in the yellow caught my eye several times and i finally tried it on ! so cute and perfect for transitional weather . threw it over the striped top that was hanging in the changing room . ended up with both !"
__label__1 "love this top . great twist on a traditional plaid . looks great with skinny jeans or leggings . i get compliments on it every time i wear it ."
